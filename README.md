# CYCLE-Cross-Year-Contrastive-Learning-in-Entity-linking

The implementation of our approach is based on the original codebase [BLINK](https://github.com/facebookresearch/BLINK) and [HeCo](https://github.com/liun-online/HeCo).<br>

Knowledge graphs evolve with new entities emerging, existing definitions being revised, and relationships between entities changing. These changes can lead to temporal degradation in entity linking models, a phenomenon where model performance declines over time. Aggregating information from neighbors through relationships can enhance the distinguishability of similar entities and thus help to ameliorate temporal degradation. Nonetheless, sparse connectivity makes entities with few neighbors (low-degree nodes) or no neighbors (isolated nodes) less resistant to temporal degradation. To address this problem, we introduce CYCLE: Cross-Year Contrastive Learning in Entity-linking model. We employ graph contrastive learning to enhance performance for low-degree nodes, thereby reducing the impact of temporal degradation. By using the features of temporal data, we are able to construct a cross-year contrastive mechanism. Specifically, in each year's data, we treat newly added relationships as positive samples, and newly removed relationships as negative samples. 
This approach allows our model to effectively prevent temporal degradation, demonstrating a 13.90\% performance boost over a strong baseline when the time gap is one year and an improvement to 17.79\% as the gap expands to three years.

## Usage

Please follow the instructions next to reproduce our experiments, and to train a model with your own data.

### 1. Install the requirements

Creating a new environment (e.g. with `conda`) is recommended. Use `requirements.txt` to install the dependencies:

```
conda create -n cycle311 -y python=3.11 && conda activate gclel311
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
